Project 4 - Semaphore

All the three tasks given have been implemented in project four.

Providing System Calls - works fine - Full Fledged
Providing a semaphore synchronization service - works fine - Full Fledged
Implementing the actual semaphore functionality by providing a user application program - works fine - tested for different inputs.

Lessons learned from this project.

Learned how to implement a system call, semaphore service and also how to solve the critical section problem using semaphores by the user application program in task 3 that includes the student and the professor synchrnization.Learned to make modifications to the source to start a new server. Also learned the different directories under the servers and what they contain. This wa looked into in detail in this project than the earlier ones.The Semaphore service works in the same manner as the Lock service, which enables a business process to request, renew, or delete a lock for a particular resource, except that the Semaphore service allows 1-n semaphores (locks) to exist on a particular resource instead of just one lock.
